# Course Introduction

Students will study Android APIs and learn to build significant Android applications. The course will have a practical focus, with significant in-class programming, programming assignments and a large project (optionally with a partner). The course philosophy is that programming is learned by doing. While the course focuses on Android, we will learn general principles of software engineering and mobile app development.

The course assumes familiarity with programming and object-oriented terminology. The course is taught entirely in Kotlin, the modern sibling of Java. We will spend a bit of time reviewing Kotlin, but you are expected to be familiar enough with Java that the transition will be seamless. The course does not assume any previous experience with Android programming.
